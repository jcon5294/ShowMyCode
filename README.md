ShowMyCode is a python/javascript app that will animate through the interactions between functions in your code as it runs. Simply run "python connect.py name-of-script-to-inspect-without-fileext" and the app should fire up with a nice animation. Note that this is still a work in progress, and requires (1.) the inspected script to have a main function, so we know where to start, and (2.) that main function cannot take any arguments, because we don't handle those yet. This can be easily fixed, though, in about 5 lines. We'll get to it in the future.
